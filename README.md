# Coding-Portfolio
# <Dean-Ketchamrk's-Portfolio>

## Description
This is my second coding project in the bootcamp. This one was mainly all on our own we had to write al lthe code in the HTML and CSS files. This was a little weird and made me nervous to say the least because i didn't want to mess up. Creating the portfolio was interesting because it feels so empty right now since i just started coding and dont have that many projects under my belt yet.
